In this repo I will share some scripts that I use with GoldenGate.

[My Postman Collection with common REST API Actions](OGG.postman_collection.json)
This script is heavily based on variables that can be configured at the session level (Current Value) or permanently (Initial Value), so take a minute to understand each variable.

Currently it supports:
User Creation(createUser)
Credential Creation(createCredential)
Distribution Path Creation(createDistPath)
Add Schema Trandata(addTrandata)
Extract Creation(createExtract)
Create Checkpoint Table(createCkptTable)
Create Replicat in the same deployment(createReplicatSameDeployment)
